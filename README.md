# Statistical Arbitrage with Cointegration

## Pairs Trading & Statistical Arbitrage

**Statistical arbitrage** refers to strategies that employ statistical models or methods to take advantage of apparent mispricing of assets, while maintaining market neutrality.

**Pairs trading** is a strategy employed by algorithmic traders that identifies two assets whose prices historically move together. The goal is to track the spread (the difference between their prices) and, once the spread widens, buy the asset that has dropped below the common trend and short the one that is overperforming. Profits are generated when the prices converge, and the positions are closed.

This strategy extends to a multivariate context by forming baskets from multiple securities and trading one asset against a basket of others.

## Pairs Trading in Practice

The strategy involves two phases:
1. **Formation phase**: Identify securities with a long-term mean-reverting relationship. Ideally, the spread should have high variance to allow for frequent profitable trades while reliably reverting to the common trend.
2. **Trading phase**: Set entry and exit rules to trade based on price movements causing the spread to diverge and converge.

### Key Concepts
- Statistical arbitrage uses statistical models to identify opportunities based on relative mispricing of assets.
- Pairs trading is the simplest form of statistical arbitrage.
- A multi-asset extension involves trading baskets of securities against one another.

### Key Considerations

    Data: Ensure that your data is loaded correctly from the appropriate files (e.g., data.h5).
    Cointegration Tests: Use Johansenâ€™s cointegration test for more advanced results with multiple time series.
    Strategy Optimization: This strategy can be extended or optimized by modifying the trading signals or incorporating additional factors.

### Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates the use of statistical arbitrage with cointegration and pairs trading strategies. By following the outlined steps, you can explore how to implement this approach and refine it for your own use cases.
